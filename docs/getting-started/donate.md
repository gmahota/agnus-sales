## Why Support This Project Financially

This project is public, which means anyone can use it. However, the project requires constant maintenance as it is not an official WhatsApp tool. Many parents and other users rely on this project for their daily needs, and it is crucial that it functions correctly. You can be the person who makes a difference.

## Programmers

Our programmers are involved in various paid projects, and this particular project is especially challenging to maintain. It relies on exploiting vulnerabilities in WhatsApp, which requires ongoing efforts to improve the system. However, so far, our programmers are volunteering their time to maintain this project.

## Dropout

Over time, it is common for many programmers to drop out of projects like this due to increasing psychological pressure, relentless demands, and the constant need to fix errors. Why? The main reason is the lack of financial support to sustain their efforts. Talented programmers seek opportunities that offer more substantial financial returns, and it is understandable that they abandon voluntary projects like this.

## Conclusion

Modest contributions from many contributors can ensure the project's continuity with more regular updates. These symbolic donations carry profound meaning, demonstrating a genuine interest in keeping this project running.


## Personal note from Guimar√£es Mahota (Lead programmer on the project)

In my perspective, contributing financially is a genuine way to show your commitment to maintaining this project.
